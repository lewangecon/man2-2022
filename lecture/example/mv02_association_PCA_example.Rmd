```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(scatterplot3d)
```

## In-class Example

Lets use our artificial data first

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

data <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
  #=,==,
  -20, -8,
  -10,-1,
  0,0,
  10,1,
  20,8
)

```

### Step 1 

Calculate the variance-covariance matrix

```{r}
cov <- cov(data)
cov
```

### Step 2 

Obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors

```{r}
eigen <- eigen(cov)
str(eigen)
```

Note that in `R`, the eigenvalues are always returned in decreasing order, and each column of vectors corresponds to the elements in values.

```{r}
V <- eigen$vectors
d <- eigen$values
d
```

Note that eigenvectors and eigevalues toegether can back out original variance covariance matrix using the formula
$$
A = VDV^{-1}
$$

```{r}
V%*%diag(d)%*%solve(V)
```

### Step 3

```{r}
as.matrix(data)%*%V[,1]
```


Finally lets plot the dimension reduction

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 0.3256631/0.9454859, color="red", 
              linetype="dashed", size=1.5)
```


How do we do?

```{r}
round(cumsum(d)/sum(d) * 100, 2) # cumulative percentage of retrieved information
```

We have explained more than 98 percent of the variance, which is a pretty good summary!




### Final Note

Note that any multiples of eigenvectors are eigenvectors, too. For example, lets multiple the first eigenvector by $-1$

```{r}
V
V[,1] <- (-1)*V[,1]
V

```

```{r}
V%*%diag(d)%*%solve(V)
```



## Teapot Example

This example is taken from [Learning Machines by Holger K. von Jouanne-Diedrich](https://blog.ephorie.de/intuition-for-principal-component-analysis-pca). Lets read the data first

```{r}
# You need to change the directory to where you actually save your own data
setwd("/Users/lewang/Dropbox/02\ teaching/econ5043/02lectures/lecture2/data")
dat <- as.matrix(read.csv("teapot.csv", header = FALSE))
head(dat)
```

```{r}
# teapot in 3D
scatterplot3d(dat[ , 1], dat[ , 2], dat[ , 3], highlight.3d = TRUE, angle = 75, pch = 19, lwd = 15, xlab = "", ylab = "", zlab = "", main = "teapot in 3D")
```

Lets perform the PCA manually here. Since we are converting this to a 2-D graph, we will take only the first two eigenvectors or principal components. 

```{r}
# PCA
(eigenval <- eigen(cov(dat))$values)
## [1] 2050.6935  747.5764  553.4070

eigenvec <- eigen(cov(dat))$vectors
# take only the two eigenvectors with biggest eigenvalues
PCA_2 <- dat %*% eigenvec[ , 1:2] 
```




```{r}
plot(PCA_2, ylim = c(50, -55), pch = 19, lwd = 35, col= "blue", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "teapot in 2D")
```


How do we do here?

```{r}
round(cumsum(eigenval)/sum(eigenval) * 100, 2) # cumulative percentage of retrieved information
```


## Financial market of fixed income securities

This example is drawn from [Notes by Kurt Hornik](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/~hornik/QFS1/principal_component-vignette.pdf). The data for this analysis are available for download [here](https://github.com/rforge/qfin/blob/master/pkg/Rsafd/data/us.bis.yield.rda). It concerns the market of fixed income securities. In particular, we use the data of the US yield curve provided by the bank of international settlement (BIS). 

Lets first look at our data. Data `us.bis.yield` gives for each trading day, starting at the 3rd of January 1995, the yields on the US
Treasury bonds for different times to maturity (in months: $x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5$)

```{r}
head(us.bis.yield)
```


```{r}
dim(us.bis.yield)
```

The different maturities should be the colnames of our data matrix:

```{r}
colnames(us.bis.yield) <- c("m0", "m1", "m2", "m3", "m4", "m5", "m5.5", "m6.5", "m7.5", "m8.5", "m9.5")
```


```{r}
eigen(cov(us.bis.yield))
```


Instead of a manual approach, we can also use the built-in function `prcomp` for this purpose. 

```{r}
us.bis.yield.pca <- prcomp(us.bis.yield)
us.bis.yield.pca
```

We can extract the variances of the three components (the first three Eigenvalues) with

```{r}
us.bis.yield.pca.var <- us.bis.yield.pca$sdev^2 
us.bis.yield.pca.var[1:3]
```

Lets plot the first four principal components for each series

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(us.bis.yield.pca$rotation[, 1], ylim = c(-0.7, 0.7)) 
plot(us.bis.yield.pca$rotation[, 2], ylim = c(-0.7, 0.7)) 
plot(us.bis.yield.pca$rotation[, 3], ylim = c(-0.7, 0.7)) 
plot(us.bis.yield.pca$rotation[, 4], ylim = c(-0.7, 0.7))
```

1. The first loading is essentially flat, so a component on this loading represents the average yield over the maturities. 

2. The monotone nature of the second loading might indicate the trend in the yield curve. 

3. The shape of the third loading suggests that the third component captures the curvature nature of the yield curve. 

4. Finally, the shape of the fourth loading does not seem to have an obvious interpretation. (Remember, that most of the variation is explained by the first three components.)
