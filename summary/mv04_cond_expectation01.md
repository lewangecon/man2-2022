# Machine Learning (V): Conditional Expectation and Linear Regression

## Detailed Topics to be Covered

1. Conditional Expectation

    1. Motivation (continuous $Y$ and discrete $X$)
    2. Which feature of the conditional distribution to focus on?
    3. What is CEF?
    4. The use of CEF: Prediction and Marginal Effects
    5. Two Properties of CEF: Prediction Property and Decomposition Property
    6. Implementation in R
      

2. Linear Regression as a computational tool for CEF

    1. What is linear regression? 
    2. What is the prediction based on a linear regression model?
    3. What are intercept and slope?
    4. Factor variables and two equivalent forms of linear regression models:
    
        1. Model without intercept: CEF for prediction
        2. Model with intercept: CEF for partial effects
        
    5. Implementation in R
    6. Why does it work?

3. When is linear regression not working? And what to do?

    1. Conditional Mean for two discrete variables
    2. Linear Regression
    3. General Rule for multiple discrete variables.
